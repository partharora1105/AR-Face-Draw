# AR-Face-Draw (For IOS)
AR-Face-Draw is a project that combines RealityKit's face detection with PencilKit to implement virtual face-painting. This project allows users to use their iPad or iPhone running iOS 15.0+ or iPadOS 15.0+ respectively to paint on their own faces or the faces of others in augmented reality.

## Requirements
- iOS 15.0+ (for iPhone)
- iPadOS 15.0+ (for iPad)
- Xcode 13.0+

## Installation and Setup
- Clone the project repository from GitHub.
- Open the project in Xcode 13.0+.
- Ensure you have an iOS 15.0+ device (iPhone or iPad) or the respective simulator selected as the build target.
- Build and run the project on the selected device or simulator.

## Acknowledgement
